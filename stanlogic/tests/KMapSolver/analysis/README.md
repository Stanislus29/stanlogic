**10-Variable Term Distribution Analysis**

Characterizes term distributions at the boundary of practical K-map visualization. Provides insight into algorithm behavior when transitioning to hierarchical minimization methods.

**Significance:**
- Represents threshold between 3D and hierarchical approaches
- Demonstrates computational challenges at large scales
- Validates correctness of hierarchical decomposition
- Establishes baseline for higher-dimensional analysis

**Data Generated:**
- Comprehensive term count datasets
- Statistical analysis across multiple test iterations
- Visual representations of distribution patterns
- Comparative metrics against lower-dimensional cases

### dense_4var_terms_test.py
**4-Variable Dense Distribution Term Analysis**

Analyzes term count distributions for 4-variable Boolean functions with dense output patterns (predominantly TRUE values, typically 70% ones).

**Focus:**
- Dense distribution characteristics
- Comparison with balanced and sparse patterns
- Impact of high TRUE ratio on minimization complexity
- Statistical characterization of dense pattern solutions

### dense_8var_terms_test.py
**8-Variable Dense Distribution Term Analysis**

Extends dense distribution analysis to 8-variable functions, examining how predominantly TRUE output patterns affect solution complexity at medium scale.

### dense_10var_terms_test.py
**10-Variable Dense Distribution Term Analysis**

Characterizes dense distribution minimization at the 10-variable threshold, providing insights into high-dimensionality dense pattern handling.

## Common Analysis Workflow

1. **Test Case Generation:** Random or systematic Boolean function creation
2. **Minimization Execution:** StanLogic algorithm application
3. **Metric Collection:** Solution characteristic measurement
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Distribution characterization and hypothesis testing
5. **Visualization:** Histogram and plot generation
6. **Result Interpretation:** Findings documentation and analysis

## Output Locations

Analysis results are typically saved to:
- `../outputs/obtain_terms_frequency/` for term distribution studies
- Individual analysis script directories (when applicable)
- Timestamped result files to prevent overwriting

## Usage

Execute individual analysis scripts:

```bash
cd StanLogic/tests/KMapSolver/analysis
python check_boolean_equivalence.py
python balanced_4var_terms_test.py
# etc.
```

Each script is self-contained and documents its specific configuration and output format.

## Research Applications

Analysis tools support:
- Algorithm validation and verification
- Performance characterization studies
- Solution quality assessment
- Comparative analysis against established tools
- Educational material development
- Publication-ready data generation

## Dependencies

Standard scientific Python stack:
- numpy (numerical operations)
- matplotlib (visualization)
- scipy (statistical analysis, if used)
- sympy (for comparative validation)

Ensure all dependencies are installed before executing analysis scripts.
